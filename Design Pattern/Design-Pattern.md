## Q. What is the Observer pattern, and how does C# implement it?
The Observer pattern defines a one-to-many relationship: a subject maintains a list of observers and notifies them when its state changes. In .NET, this is commonly implemented using delegates and the event keyword. Clients subscribe to an event (backed by a delegate) on the subject. When the subject changes, it invokes the delegate, calling all registered handlers. An event is essentially an automatic notification that some action has occurred, built on delegates. Thus C#’s event construct encapsulates the Observer pattern.
