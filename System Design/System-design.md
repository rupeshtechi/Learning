Software architectural patterns are general, reusable solutions to common problems in software architecture. They provide a structured framework for designing and implementing software systems, offering guidelines and best practices to ensure the system is scalable, maintainable, and robust.

1) 𝐄𝐯𝐞𝐧𝐭-𝐃𝐫𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐧 𝐀𝐫𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞: Components communicate through events, ideal for real-time processing.
2) 𝐋𝐚𝐲𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐝 𝐀𝐫𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞: Organizes the system into layers, each with a specific responsibility, promoting separation of concerns.
3) 𝐌𝐨𝐧𝐨𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐜 𝐀𝐫𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞: All functionalities are combined into a single application, suitable for simpler, smaller applications.
4) 𝐌𝐢𝐜𝐫𝐨𝐬𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞 𝐀𝐫𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞: The System is divided into independent services, each responsible for a specific function, allowing for scalability and flexibility.
5) 𝐌𝐕𝐂 (𝐌𝐨𝐝𝐞𝐥-𝐕𝐢𝐞𝐰-𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐫): This approach separates the application into three interconnected components, separating internal representations of information from how information is presented and accepted.
6) 𝐌𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐫-𝐒𝐥𝐚𝐯𝐞 𝐀𝐫𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞: One component (master) controls one or more other components (slaves), commonly used in database replication.
